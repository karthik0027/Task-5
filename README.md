# Task-5
This project involves training and evaluating Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers on a Heart Disease dataset using Scikit-learn. We visualize the decision tree, control overfitting by tuning max depth, compare model performances, and interpret feature importances. Cross-validation is used for robust evaluation.

Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

To run the code:
```bash
python task5_decision_tree_random_forest.py
